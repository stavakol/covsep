        New submission
        Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
          Covariance (2:37)
          arXiv (13:5)
          covariance (10:43, 11:69)

    I believe that arXiv is spelled like this, and that covariance is written without
    a final 's' when speaking of covariance structure.
